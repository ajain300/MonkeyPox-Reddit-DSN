            "VoxAeternus: My original point was not about what was specifically said, it was their reaction to what was said. Ideologues like these young adults are much less likely to have their mind changed when hard objective evidence is shown to them, and are more likely to violently lash out when compared to a conspiracy nut.All they care about is having their \"side\" win and to control what opinions people can have, because they project their intentions onto their \"enemies\", with the thought of \"If I was in their position I would do X, so they must be trying to do X, so I must stop them from doing X to me by doing X to them first.\">There are physiological changes while transitioning too, and that is factual too.And there a recent studies showing that those changes during transition only get you roughly half way when compared to the innate physiological differences between the sexes. This doesn't matter when you have Ideologues within these colleges/activist groups who believe in what is essentially Tabula Rosa and that there are no objective biological differences at all, pre or post transition. They are just subjective social constructs to them.>And there is a steep difference in age between these kids and flat earthers, I don't know why you try to tone it down. These kids are teenagers or close? But it doesn't matter to you?Flat earthers have been around longer, so you can expect them to have older demographics on average, but there are Flat earthers just as young as these young adults. Just like how there are similar ideologues who are in their 30s and 40s who are either their professors, politicians, or run activists organizations.Why are you trying to infantilize them? They could be 17 or 39, it doesn't matter their age when it comes to their actions in the video. If they want to be taken seriously then I will treat them as adults and criticize their actions and evaluate their opinions as such. If you want them to be treated \"kids\" then their opinions mean nothing and they shouldn't be taken seriously, because it seems like you would want to absolve them of their actions and responsibilities because they are too immature.\n",

Some of these people run social media accounts with lots of followers, and can really fuck-up someone unassuming (like most people in academia are). I've read books written by psychology professors where they state something obvious like \"women are different then men\" and then spend two pages on qualifying that statement, excusing themselves, explaining that this doesn't mean x, y, z and so on. They're doing this because they are afraid of these people. Their careers are on the line.\n",

            "TheNorseHorseForce: Over time (and I mean over a decade+/generation timeline), those heavily leaning districts balance out. Eventually, the people of that area,  who are not hard left/right-leaning, will leave.  Then comes the silo. All silos eventually collapse on themselves,  especially when they try to expand that solo. And to note, this example is still in the beginning stages. I'm,  in no way,  suggesting that this is \"now.\"I'm not calling any specific group out,  I'm just noting that one of the biggest examples of this is in the US is Portland. Beautiful city,  amazing area, and many wonderful people. But the city government alongside the activity of some of its citizens is starting to form that silo. If it keeps going the way it is without relief, history suggests it'll become, geopolitically,  economically,  and educationally,  similar to North Korea. (Once again, I'm not saying dictatorship with starving citizens and slave labor.  I'm saying geopolitically)When one entity, whether it's a person or institution,  makes demands or decisions of others that are non-negotiable and/or outside of the realm of reality for everyone else, then there's no conversation or push for progress. We are already seeing small tidbits of that,  with certain cities having harder times making agreements with Portland.  Alongside this, the truly saddening truth regarding education. When children are given a severely silo'd education (once again, of any nature), those children will suffer socially once they teach adulthood.  They'll go out into the world and realize that life isn't the same as their upbringing. Either they'll adapt or return home to repeat the cycle. With that said, all silos eventually become unsustainable and will collapse. If a silo reaches the point of no return where no one is willing to work with them,  no one is moving in,  and no one can leave; it crumbles.  And subsequently,  the long arduous process for balance begins anew. I understand that we are far off from this scenario anywhere in the US, but we're starting to see groundwork for it in bits and pieces in different areas of the country. This is why Canada was in such an uproar about the recent bill that tried to compel speech. Gerrymandered districts are a scary thing,  especially when they have population density to outvote multiple districts. But,  the saving grace is that people aren't *forced* to stay. Mass exodus' are occurring, people moving to other parts of the country, trying to \"get out of that particular Dodge.\"\n",

Buddy of mine told me the one he was working at was just like this and went out and hired some woman.

No. Should we pick on you because you believe in something different? No. People with deppression sometimes have it for life but learn to deal with it and most of the time (outliers) never force it on others. I have gay family members, they dont force it in conversation and make it there personality, its why we can have respectful conversations.

He started preferring male pronouns about a year ago.I don't think social media is the whole blame.  Yes, it is a catalyst for rapid information transfer.  In this case, the idea of transness being a neutral idea with no inherant moral failings in and of itself is revolutionary.  Total autonomy over how one presents oneself is, in my opinion, a worthy persuit.In the past, before the internet, revolutionary ideas had generations to gestate in the public conciousness before being allowed to become a reality.  Before we all started living in single family homes, multiple generations of families living together made it difficult to stray against the norm becaus grams and gramps would insure that social norms were adhered to.Now, this trans \"fad\" is happenning at rapid speed.  Are these kids being brainwashed or are they being educated about revolutionary ideas that just make sense (total body autonomy)?  The biggest harm they face isnt from the hormones or the surgeries, which are frankly nobody's business, but from the idiots who look and see something they dont understand and simply want to lable them mentally ill.  It wasn't that long ago when homosexuality was considered a mental illness...  just something to consider.\n",

A child with gender dysphoria being forced to undergo puberty is the same irreversible hormonal changes you're fearing a cis child might go through. Except it'd happen at an earlier age, would be against their will, and would be harder to reverse than puberty blockers. Not to mention, the proportion of people who regret transition and detransition is around 1%-3%, so you're arguing for condemning 97 trans kids to an even worse fate per 1-3 cis children that you want to save from a lesser fate. >  Particularly some children were conditioned from birth by their lunatic parents, and started hormone therapy well underageThere is no evidence of this ever happening\n",

            "TranscendentalEmpire: > conditioned or mistakenly believe they are trans and start hormone therapy or go for surgery, that is irreparable damage.I specialize in orthopedics and rehabilitation, so I can't speak expertly on the specifics of gender reassignment. However, I can give a good idea of how healthcare providers weigh potential patient outcomes. Everything in medicine is now geared toward pt outcomes since Obamacare. You have to outline and validate your reason for treatment, and that has to reasonably match your eventual potential outcome. Meaning that physicians conducting transitions especially for minors have to weigh the potential for misdiagnosis before giving treatment. In able to provide a transition as healthcare, you have to think about the effects of the patient changing their mind. This generally means that you are weighing the potential outcome of no treatment vs the potential of mistreatment. So you're essentially weighting the potential no treatment, which comes with a much higher risk of suicide vs the PT changing their mind, which could possibly lead to an increase of suicide. The thing is most people don't regret their transition, and there's a lot of supporting research saying it help mitigate potential for suicide.\n",

If you hate crime a different minority with the same accusations and tactics.... you are correct, and I'll participate!\"> research on this is almost impossibleThat's simply not true. The first clinic to do scientific research on trans people began in pre-ww2 Berlin, it was one of the first minority group victimized by the Nazis.  It has continued to this day, as I just linked you a study from 2022. The theory that it's just too spicy for scientist to criticize is just ridiculous. The majority of the country either dislikes or doesn't really care about trans people in general. Plenty of people have released anti trans books that have made them plenty of money. The reason there isn't a lot of scientific studies that portray trans people In a bad light is because it's for the most part a social issue. In the cases that aren't medical, professionals are measuring patient outcomes. When measuring these outcomes as a healthcare provider you are taking into account the potential harm of hormone therapy vs the potential harm of a much higher rate of suicide. Not a lot of outcomes are weighted heavier than a patient commiting suicide. > unfortunately, speaking up about it, gives power to people that truly do wish trans people didn’t exist or didn’t have protections or acceptanceYes, repeating propaganda is tacit approval of said propaganda.

The parents of these kids are not happy that their children have made choices to present themselves in a way that will lead to discrimination. They are just scared and desperately attempting to do anything that will prevent their children from wanting to end their lives.

            "Saymynaian: And *this* is why the world is so fucked. Because somehow the Left went from being the technologically progressive academic and scientific movement to \"Equality means everyone is identical\". I've run into this horseshit so much in academia and it makes supporting progressive movements unpalatable. I completely understand why society has come to a standstill and is regressing basic civil rights. Supporting the Left feels like passing a healthcare bill with an addendum at the end that says \"You need to send me flowers and kisses or I'll be mad and call you a fascist Nazi sexist and everything good you accomplished and are attempting to accomplish will be null. Also, science isn't real anymore and men and women are identical in every possible way\"\n",

            "Saymynaian: I mean, you wouldn't be entirely wrong to assume that. Both Left and Right have their loud minorities ruining their movements (although I'd argue there's very little worth saving in the fiscal part of being conservative), but the fact that both sides tolerate these vocal minorities and accept their support instead of shunning them means both Left and Right are fucking up.Essentially, who are you letting sit at your table and take decisions alongside you? The Left allows these people to influence their decision making, while the Right has all but been taken over by genuinely bad people who support Trump. Sure, not all of them are this dumb, but there are enough that have collapsed the culturally conservative side of the Right, which I believe to have at least some value, into antidemocratic and un-American beliefs. If you still support that movement without shunning these people, you might as well be one of them (metaphorically, of course). So yes, your sentiment is kind of correct, except you'd have to call me a pussy crybaby liberal misandrist, since I'm very much left leaning in regards to finances, technology, and most social progression.\n",

            "Confident-Lack5153: They have literally been teaching this at most major universities for 10 years.  It was what made Jordan Peterson famous, people always act like it was the pronouns but the professor that pushed the pronoun thing is the professor that Peterson argued with and she/he directly said there were no physiological differences between man and woman.  she/he was obviously being purposefully combative meaning in their specific field of study the term man in not referring to males, this little but significant point isn't often translated to the blue haired recent high school graduates that will parrot whatever new information they think sounds good.  So we have almost 10 years of college educated people and half of those folks truly believe that someone older smarter and wiser has shown scientific evidence and proof that there are no differences between men and women and people who believe there are differences have been brainwashed by male dominated authoritarian systems worthy of destruction.  This is complete insanity yet there it is.  The religious side of \"science\" is when people just believe whatever they are told because they think it comes from someone they would label \"scientist\" and don't actually do any of the science stuff like independently verify results, or you know, think about it for a second.\n",

But this video is edited to make it even worse because they don't want to leave any room for the viewer to think critically. Just skim through the original comments on this post for 60 seconds and think how different it would be if the actual events were shown accurately. People would still be against the kids, but some people would be having a conversation about it, instead of blindly echoing ridicules at them. This is a huge problem and honestly it's probably why these kids are like that too. They've likely seen clips of Damore in their echo chambers, don't bother to corroborate any of the facts, then get reinforced by the others who are doing the same. Context is important. Whether or not people are idiots is not enough, why people are being idiots is important too. Having conversations with everyone, regardless of their differing view points is important. And extremism is destructive and purposefully being reinforced in order to prevent all of these things, to keep us as cult members instead of actual people.\n",

            "Grabbsy2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCrQ3EU8_PMThis does appear to be the full video. I'm watching it now. Its a very odd preamble. Theres a different man that pre-empts what I assume is a pre-planned walkout. He introduced a feminist author, and his little fun fact? \"Last night, for the first time, she had tacos, and didn't worry one little bit about cultural appropriation\" (approx 5:30)What is he doing? Goading protestors? I mean, fine, thats hilarious, but if the event goes on to goad protestors at every moment, of course theyre peices of shit. Anyways, let me watch on.Edit: at 07:01 the same speaker pre-empts again, saying that one of the speakers, James Demore, is one guy, who wrote a book on why some women choose not to work in engineering, but there is a \"phantom\" james demore, who wrote that women CAN'T work in engineering.So either there really is 2 james demores, and these SJWs made a mistake, and walked out anyways when they just got tired of waiting for something offensive to happen... or there is one james demore, and his work can either be \"taken two ways\", or is being misrepresented by SJWs to make him look evil.Either way, I think this is a CLUSTERFUCK of information... lol. I could easily round up a group of literal teenagers to protest something, if I said \"The person speaking at this believes women shouldn't work in Engineering.\" Edit2: I stopped watching there to read wikipedia on him:  >Damore withdrew his complaint with the National Labor Relations Board before the board released any official findings. However, shortly before the withdrawal, an internal NLRB memo found that his firing was legal. The memo, which was not released publicly until February 2018, said that, whereas the law shielded him from being fired solely for criticizing Google, it did not protect discriminatory statements, that his memo's \"statements regarding biological differences between the sexes were so harmful, discriminatory, and disruptive as to be unprotected\", and that these \"discriminatory statements\", not his criticisms of Google, were the reason for his firing.So while you might not agree with the findings of the board, this is still clear evidence SJWs can point to and say \"see? Hes sexist\" so its hard to blame protestors for showing up. Granted, trying to sabotage the audio was extreme, especially since there wasn't much drama happening on stage to drive them to such a reaction.Not to mention, this is a panel discussion/debate, so everyone should have a chance to speak.\n",

It doesn't mean that women or men can't do certain things that the other can do, nor does it mean they can't be better at something that the other gender is naturally more adapted to. But it does mean that each gender on average is more likely to succeed at certain things. Men tend to have higher muscle density and therefore are more adapted to things suck as body building. Where as women tend to have higher pain tolerances and are therefore more adapted for things such as long distance running. Getting offended by something like this serves no purpose. If the person is genuinely being bigoted either ignore them or try to educate them, their bigotry may come from a place of ignorance. Reacting adversely will just affirm the stereotype to them. If they are saying it to be offensive reacting this way is the exact response they are looking for. People rarely change their option because someone screamed at them and called them fascist.

            "PsychologicalObject2: What I understand the least about these people, is why is gender that important to them? Why does it mean anything more to them than a box you check on applications? A descriptive term like whether you are hot or cold?They make it their entire lives. They live under the guise “I can’t be happy unless everyone else sees me as a ‘she’ or a ‘he’ or a ‘they’”. Really? That is what you want you whole life to be about? That’s what you want everyone to remember you for? I just don’t get it\n",
            "ImNotSue: I think you're missing that this lecturer is likely arguing against gender identity and trans identity.  It's a big deal because if someone else made it a big deal that you *can't* be something you want to express, you absolutely can't be that thing casually without making it a big deal.  Here's an easy example: I'm non-binary.  I don't really care about my own gender and feel agender because literally nothing I could do would feel genuinely feminine or masculine.  But it's not a big deal because my husband doesn't care and my friends are totally cool with it.  I prefer they/them but also am totally okay with the gendered pronouns I was raised with.  I wear clothes that I think look good on me regardless of gender.  I don't try to pass as the opposite sex cus it's not what I'm interested in, so when busybodies pass me on the street they don't know, they're oblivious.  It's not a big deal because nobody gets in my face for me being who I want to be.  No random person has to impose their view of the world on me, because I fit in enough. *I'm* comfortable with people default gendering me based on my sex and nobody is getting on my case telling me I can't be what I want for violating their view of what their perceived I should be.  But if someone tells you that you can't be something because it makes THEM uncomfortable that you don't fit their world view  Then, it's a big deal.  And there's a lot of different ways you can generalize that sort of intolerance.  A lot.  Not just for gender identity.  History can teach you a lot about that.If someone told me I can't be non-binary because they think I have mental illness for not fitting into what they think is 'natural' and then go out of their way to spew hate and vitriol onto me for being this way?  Like, a family member?  How about a hometown?  A community?  A country?Then you can bet it's a big deal to me.  I don't even ask much, hardly anything of people.  Most people just want you to address them by name.  Say 'him' or 'her'.  And to not treat them like shit.  Who doesn't want that? That shouldn't be a lot to ask.  It's not a lot to ask.\n",

Plenty of studies on this all point to this.So question is, does he say men are **better suited** or **pick this road more often**? Cuz first statement would be dumb while second is true. Do you have a direct quote?What i mean is that, if men choose a field more they will obviously be the majority at it. However that doesn't mean women are worse at the job, just that they pick it less given the chance.\n",

It just means on average they are less interested in this field and thus men will dominate the ranks more.\n",

As a species made great strides in our society, made mistakes and learned not only what were mistakes but how to fix them. People focused on what knowledge could help as a whole and weren’t scared of the facts but used reason and intelligence to debate and prove things. Are humans as a species really about to let ignorance overwhelm for the sake of someone’s “feelings” those chemical reactions in your brain that can be unbalanced and easily manipulated? Knowledge scares more people now then it did in the past. False information is spread as facts to make people feel better or “good”. The children will inherit these new traits and “knowledge” in this civilization and it could negatively effect the efficiency of the species. Why is the counter to these people so silent when it is necessary to change it now before it grows further out of control.Note: these words are paraphrased and altered but have been heard from multiple sources and were not said in reference to this topic but I feel as though they fit here as well.\n",

Man is derived from the old english word for Person where as Woman is from the same time and literally means Female Person.  Man/Male and Woman/Female have been interchangeable for a very long time and its only relatively recently that Man and Woman have started to be used to describe gender rather than sex.  Its not universal though and while its use is growing it doesn't mean that its exclusively the new meaning of the words purely because some people say they are.  It will gravitate one way or the other and my assumption is that it will end up being the way to describe gender rather than sex but we don't have anything like the '40 immortals' managing the English language like they do with French so it takes time for the usage to settle down into a new norm.\n",

They left because they know what the argument that lady is trying to make is. They know what she's going to say after she lays down facts and how she's going to pervert those facts to fit her narrative that women should be subservient to men. If you don't know the argument, then I'm sure you're left thinking that the people in blue hair are the crazy ones, and not the lady calmly talking about the differences between men and women. Too bad we didn't get to hear her get to the part about how women's primary focus should be staying at home and child rearing while the men go work.\n",

Her sound bite may have sounded reasonable, but I guarantee that it was wrapped in pseudoscientific bullshit.\n",

            "nopestalgic: More context is needed here. We don't know why this women is discussing biological differences. Is she doing so to limit trans rights in her community? Then yeah, people can be rightfully upset. Everyone understands that there are biological differences between the sexes. This is actually the whole issue with being trans - that their biological sex doesn't align with what their brain is telling them. And early research has indicated possible structural/functional differences in the brain, where people who are transgender align more with the gender they identify with rather than their biological sex. That's the whole issue.So if this woman is trying to deny access to services, et cetera, and then spouts basic facts as if it is a gotcha moment, then I probably would be annoyed in their position, too.\n",

I’m sure it was well intentioned, but they’ve fallen a long way from being voices of reason on gender politics and the Evergreen College fiasco.Now they spend their time on Twitter spreading vaccine misinformation. Praising ivermectin without any sound scientific support; making wild insinuations about COVID vaccine harmfulness and never circling back around to inform their followers when their theory turned out to be a dud, instead just moving on to the next theory.Just go look at the people who comment favorably on their Tweets within the last 2 years. It’s almost become a meme how reliably you can find their bios filled with die-hard Trumpism, thin blue line, Alex Jones fans, and of course straight up anti-vaxxers.Sadly they jumped the shark long ago.\n",

What conclusion that is, is important to know to understand if their freak out is warranted or not. If that woman’s argument was “Men and woman are physically different, thus psychologically different, thus woman should stay in the kitchen and obey men” then yeah fuck her. I would have walked out as well. Or she could have been making a sane and well reasoned argument. Without knowing what was said before, i can’t judge if the freak out was warranted or not.\n",

            "peppers_: Copy and pasting this from my other comment - that is [Heather Heying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heather_Heying), who appears to be anti-vax/pro-ivermectin (you know, the horse de-wormer). Without digging too deep, I'm going to assume she is a Jordan Peterson type - PhD scholar in her own field (evolutionary biology) but anything outside of that is just poorly informed opinion, but her other credentials make it appear that she is smart, so the right latch onto her like Peterson and give credence to her talking about things outside her area of expertise.Now, as to this event (held by a student group called Freethinkers of PSU), it took place in 2018, here is an [article](https://www.theclackamasprint.net/news/james-damore-sparks-protests-at-portland-state-university-during-visit/) and here is the [video](https://youtu.be/VCrQ3EU8_PM), in which a former Google employee was also a panelist, James Damore. This guy had posted a memo, for which he was fired for, in which one of the things he said were that women biologically were different and that was why there was a gender gap at Google ([wikipedia on the memo here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google%27s_Ideological_Echo_Chamber)). So in the video, I'm not surprised people got up and left, they probably came in knowing they'd be hearing garbage and when they were seeing this setup by Heying (and that is what her 'men are on average taller than women' thing was), were saying enough is enough. Heying at the part of the video was about to go about how men's and women's brains are different, I assume she would go on to talk about the misogynistic talking point of men being smarter/better suited for that work.Interesting side note, the person who introduced the panel appears to be [Andy Ngo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Ngo), who is a conservative journalist that covers protests as his main focus. People are critical on his edits to videos that he posts. I couldn't find enough about the student group Freethinkers of PSU to figure out if they are a right wing group or what, but based on what I have found, I assume so at this point. I bring this up, because I wanted to see if there was a left leaning or right leaning bias to this, and I think it is safe to assume there is a right leaning bias here.So this video smells funny to me because almost all context is not included in it, but this is reddit after all.\n",
