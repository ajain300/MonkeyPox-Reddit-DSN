There used to be a permanent ban if you had ever as a man had sex with another man or were a woman who had sex with a man who had sex with another man.', ""Wow, I can't believe I didn't know that. Thank you, I'll definitely look into the book and see. I am always floored by the parts of queer history I was never taught that come up in random parts of my life, and I just never knew about it. But thank you so much, and I'll keep it in mind in the future."", ""The book is an absolute tome- and it should be required reading for all high schoolers.

Like if I were to hookup with a dude for one night stand, it probably wouldn’t be a convo with someone I just met. “Hey, I know I barely even know your name and we’re having sex in a bar bathroom but just so you know, I also sleep with women and non binary people”.

THE risk factor is having casual encounters. Mathematically, casual encounters are more numerous in the MSM demographic-- hence the *current* spread largely within those sexual networks. But there's nothing to stop a more heteronormative sex party outbreak, theoretically, if enough factors aligned. (Mathematically, the R0 in MSM sexual networks allowed for sufficient spread initially. But behaviour change in MSM, and awareness, has changed the R0-- hence the declining rates in most places.)\n\nSo one need not interrogate a partner's particular identity, or *who* they previously had sex with. If they're having casual sex with *you*, now, that alone is indicative of someone who has casual sex. That's the risk factor. Assume risk."", '>I can see this devolving into a lot of homophobia/Biphobia\n\nI can see this resulting in the proper people receiving the proper vaccination, which is way the hell more important than potential bigotry (which might or might not happen).\n\nKeep your priorities straight.

Anyone engaging in close contact is at risk.', 'I agree people need to get the vaccine, especially if they’ve been identified as a “risk” group, but challenging the bigotry of the discourse and misunderstanding is crucial because there are also millions of straight people in Canada right now who still think they’re not at any risk, more likely to write off symptoms, and can’t access testing. This will lead to a lot of unfettered spread and sickness, too. Many people still mistakenly believe this is an STD or “gay disease” like AIDS.', "">there are also millions of straight people in Canada right now who still think they’re not at any risk,\n\nStraight people are being told they're not at risk.

x35cho,"['Yo, what the hell is this money pox yo? Bitch', 'With a pinch of chili powder!!', ""Jesse you stupid junkie, Monkeypox is an infectious viral disease that can occur in humans and some other animals.  Symptoms include fever, swollen lymph nodes, and a rash that forms blisters and then crusts over. The time from exposure to onset of symptoms ranges from five to twenty-one days. The duration of symptoms is typically two to four weeks. There may be mild symptoms, and it may occur without any symptoms being known. The classic presentation of fever and muscle pains, followed by swollen glands, with lesions all at the same stage, has not been found to be common to all outbreaks. Cases may be severe, especially in children, pregnant women or people with suppressed immune systems.The disease is caused by the monkeypox virus, a zoonotic virus in the genus Orthopoxvirus. The variola virus, the causative agent of smallpox, is also in this genus. Of the two types in humans, clade II (formerly West African clade) causes a less severe disease than the Central African (Congo basin) type. It may spread from infected animals by handling infected meat or via bites or scratches. Human-to-human transmission can occur through exposure to infected body fluids or contaminated objects, by small droplets, and possibly through the airborne route. People can spread the virus from the onset of symptoms until all the lesions have scabbed and fallen off; with some evidence of spread for more than a week after lesions have crusted. Diagnosis can be confirmed by testing a lesion for the virus's DNA.There is no known cure. A study in 1988 found that the smallpox vaccine was around 85% protective in preventing infection in close contacts and in lessening the severity of the disease. A newer smallpox and monkeypox vaccine based on modified vaccinia Ankara has been approved, but with limited availability. Other measures include regular hand washing and avoiding sick people and animals. Antiviral drugs, cidofovir and tecovirimat, vaccinia immune globulin and the smallpox vaccine may be used during outbreaks. The illness is usually mild and most of those infected will recover within a few weeks without treatment. Estimates of the risk of death vary from 1% to 10%, although few deaths as a consequence of monkeypox have been recorded since 2017. Several species of mammals are suspected to act as a natural reservoir of the virus. Although it was once thought to be uncommon in humans, the quantity and severity of outbreaks has significantly increased since the 1980s, possibly as a result of waning immunity since the stopping of routine smallpox vaccination. The first cases in humans were found in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). There have been sporadic cases in Central and West Africa, and it is endemic in the DRC. The 2022 monkeypox outbreak represents the first incidence of widespread community transmission outside of Africa, which was initially identified in the United Kingdom in May 2022, with subsequent cases confirmed in at least 74 countries in all continents except Antarctica. On 23 July 2022, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) with more than 16,000 reported cases in 75 countries and territories.

Monkeypox virus is part of \r\nthe same family of viruses as smallpox. Monkeypox symptoms are like smallpox symptoms, but milder; \r\nand monkeypox is rarely fatal. Monkeypox is not related to chickenpox.\r\n• JYNNEOS (also called Imvamune or Imvanex) is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration \r\n(FDA) to prevent monkeypox infection if you are 18 years or older. \r\n• If given before exposure or within 4 days of exposure, JYNNEOS may reduce the chance of infection. If \r\ngiven between 5 and 14 days after exposure, it may lower the severity of symptoms.\r\n• You will not be fully vaccinated and getting the most benefit from this vaccine until 2 weeks after your \r\nsecond shot of JYNNEOS.\r\n• Once you’re vaccinated, you should continue to protect yourself from infection by avoiding close, skin-\r\nto-skin contact, including sex or other intimate contact, with someone who has monkeypox. \r\nNormal Side Effects You Might Experience\r\n• If you are healthy the most common reactions are: \r\no Pain and redness at the injection site \r\no Swelling, firmness, or itching near the injection site\r\no Muscle pain\r\no Headache\r\no Fatigue\r\no Nausea\r\no Chills\r\n• If you are an adult with HIV-infection or eczema, you are about as likely as those who don’t have those \r\nconditions to experience the skin-related reactions listed above.\r\n• Contraindications for JYNNEOS include severe or immediate reaction to any component of the vaccine \r\n(e.g., gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, egg protein, benzonase).The risk for a severe allergic reaction should \r\nbe weighed against the risk for disease due to monkeypox.\r\n• A person who is diagnosed with monkeypox virus infection after their first dose of JYNNEOS is not \r\nrecommended to receive the second dose at this time. A person who is eligible for the vaccine but has \r\nbeen diagnosed with monkeypox during this outbreak, which started in the United States on May 17, \r\n2022, is not recommended to be vaccinated at this time. If you had any reaction or side effect to the \r\nfirst dose of vaccine, notify your health care provider and discuss the benefits and risk of getting the \r\nsecond dose. \r\n• Call 911 immediately if you experience symptoms of an allergic reaction. These symptoms may \r\ninclude hives, swelling of the face and throat, difficulty breathing, a fast heartbeat, dizziness, or \r\nweakness. Report any reactions to your health care provider or to the Vaccine Adverse Event \r\nReporting System at 1-800-822-7967 or www.vaers.hhs.gov.\r\nWhat You Should Do Today \r\n• Today you will get your first of two doses of the JYNNEOS vaccine. You should receive your second \r\ndose in about 28 days. If you are in the local area, we can make an appointment for your second dose \r\nnow. Your second dose will only be held for you for about 5 weeks. If you are from another area, please \r\ncontact your local public health agency now to arrange to receive your second dose.']"

wsyzxh,"['Two reasons:\n\n1. M4M sex often involves anal, which can cause bleeding and expelling fluids into another person (which doesn\'t happen so often with a F2F sexual activity or is only generally one way in M2F sex), which makes things more risky. Not impossible (or guaranteed), but it does make things more risky.\n2. The far bigger reason is that gay men have sex with random hookups more often than straight or lesbian couples do (generally, there are of course exceptions) and so the odds just go up. So it\'s not ""inherently"" more dangerous since a guy who has MPX having sex with a woman is pretty much just as likely to pass it to their partner as if they had sex with a man.  But the odds that the person you\'re having sex with has MPX is more likely if you both frequently have random hookups.']"

It’s predominantly a disease of gay black men, gay Hispanic men, gay white men, straight black women in that order and the demography % wise is wildly skewed to the first and second cohort. \n\nThey’re just facts, it’s ok to discuss and probably wise to raise awareness within those groups of just how at risk they are or aren’t.

Obviously not like a baseball player on the field but droplets are spit, too. \nAs what you said about AIDS I disagree.

People use condoms outside of birth control. \nDon‘t get me wrong: I‘m not saying you‘re likely to get the monkey pox but I think your reasoning is a little off.', 'Let‘s quote the WHO:\n„Monkeypox is transmitted to humans through close contact with an infected person or animal, or with material contaminated with the virus.\nMonkeypox virus is transmitted from one person to another by close contact with lesions, body fluids, respiratory droplets and contaminated materials such as bedding.“\n\nNow for a real doctor like yourself I don‘t know if the WHO is a serious source to you. \n\nI am not a joke. I have been practising Gynaecology for 21 years. Check my profile if you don’t believe it.', 'Lots of posts above already prove you wrong.', '[removed]', ""\\> because a subset of gay men have a lot of sex, travel a lot and the network is relatively small.\n\nBut there's subsets of heterosexuals do the same thing, not to mention prostitution market.  I suppose you have to take into account this is the initial spread, and since it started with gay men it's propagating with them more exclusively.\n\nWhen it's 95% gay men it's hard to ignore, even with what's been mentioned.  It'll be interesting to see if it stays that way.  AIDS still disproportionately hits gay men the most, but that's even harder to catch than this and anal sex itself makes infection easier (so I've read at least).\n\nMakes me a lot less concerned about non-sexual contact at least."", 'Even at its peak AIDS was primarily a disease of homosexuals and IV drug users. There were of course closeted bi-sexual and IV drug users who gave it to predominantly receptive sexual partners aka women. \n\nYes things have changed a lot, but it really was overblown. I suppose better to err on the side of caution. I went thru that whole period, only person who got it I knew personally was my uncle who is homosexual. He got it from his boyfriend who *knew* he had it but didn’t disclose. This was 30 years ago…he’s still here today thanks to anti retrovirals. \n\nI wouldn’t worry about Monkeypox and I sure as hell wouldn’t race out to get a vaccine unless I was both gay and promiscuous. Sounds ugly yes, but it’s the truth.', '[deleted]', ""I'm sorry you're tired bb, maybe take a nap?"", ""Heterosexuals are also a much broader network, so there's less sharing the same partners.\n\nI'm not saying it doesn't disproportionally affects gay people. I'm saying infection is not restricted to sex. It can be cauught from bedsheets or hugging. This all happens during sex so that's why the infection are associated with sex."", '„Respiratory droplets“.\n\nMan, for a doctor you sure lack reading skills. Let‘s try again:\n\n„Human-to-human transmission can result from close contact with respiratory secretions, skin lesions of an infected person or recently contaminated objects. Transmission via droplet respiratory particles usually requires prolonged face-to-face contact, which puts health workers, household members and other close contacts of active cases at greater risk. However, the longest documented chain of transmission in a community has risen in recent years from 6 to 9 successive person-to-person infections. This may reflect declining immunity in all communities due to cessation of smallpox vaccination. Transmission can also occur via the placenta from mother to fetus (which can lead to congenital monkeypox) or during close contact during and after birth. While close physical contact is a well-known risk factor for transmission, it is unclear at this time if monkeypox can be transmitted specifically through sexual transmission routes. Studies are needed to better understand this risk.“\n\nSee, I am not saying MSM aren‘t at high risk. But saying it‘s the only way of transmission is wrong.', '[deleted]']"

wogixj,"['Before this gets removed for non-news, the article mentions *important policy proposals* related to the current Monkeypox pandemic\n\n>The ramifications of classifying human monkeypox as a sexually transmitted infection are double-edged. The stigma surrounding sexually transmitted infections in gay men and other sex with men limits healthcare seeking and partner-notification behaviors \\[18,19\\], directly subverting our primary means of outbreak control — namely, early identification and behavior change in infected individuals. Furthermore, such stigma can fuel further homophobia, particularly in areas without human rights protections for individuals who engage in same-sex relationships \\[20\\]. Conversely, failure to appropriately identify and disseminate to the public the predominant mode of transmission will likely perpetuate behaviors that are driving transmission. Identifying high-risk sub-populations, in this case gay, bisexual or other men who have sex with men, who have multiple partners, will facilitate targeted awareness and education efforts, exposure reduction and other disease intervention activities such as testing, treatment and vaccination, which in turn may augment control efforts and prove to be cost effective. Such efforts are analogous to what was eventually implemented in partnership with community-based organizations to combat the human immunodeficiency virus pandemic with notable success \\[21\\].  \n>  \n>Further, the current guidelines recommend isolation of individuals infected with human monkeypox until complete resolution of symptoms and healing of the rash, which can last for up to four weeks \\[22\\]. **We have already observed the numerous socioeconomic consequences of 10-14 days of isolation recommended during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in the form of productivity, supply chain disruptions, and agriculture production \\[23\\]. If human monkeypox is in fact predominantly transmitted through sexual contact, which the evidence above suggests that it is, that duration of isolation, and thus the consequent adverse socioeconomic impact, may be unnecessary.**\n\nThe above bolding is mine.  Also the evidence they present for the above includes\n\n>Taken in context, the temporal and anatomic association with various sex practices, the high prevalence of sexual risk behavior among patients with human monkeypox, and the in vitro infectivity of human monkeypox DNA isolated from semen strongly suggest that human monkeypox is transmitted through sexual activity.  \n>  \n>Indeed, one report concluded that all secondary cases of human monkeypox were likely due to sexual transmission — that conclusion based on anogenital and perineal localization of the rash in 72% of cases, associated inguinal lymphadenopathy in 72% of cases, and frequent report of sexual risk behaviors including condomless anal intercourse and sex with multiple partners within the preceding three weeks among 84% of cases \\[11\\]. Another report similarly noted that the clinicians seeing more than 500 patients with human monkeypox globally suspected sexual transmission in 95% of cases \\[4\\], although the specifics on how that determination was made were unavailable.  \n>  \n>Finally, further supporting the nearly exclusive sexual spread of infection in the current outbreaks is the absence of any substantial number of cases of human monkeypox associated with household or casual, non-sexual transmission.', ""I guess I should add the conclusion since it's a full summation of the article and its public health policy proposals\n\n>In Conclusion\n\n>The transmission dynamics of human monkeypox, at least across the United States and Europe, appears to be highly consistent with a sexually transmitted infection. Our public health response, therefore, should incorporate sexual health into its response to the current outbreak, including frank discussion of specific sexual behaviors like condomless anal sex that increase the risk for transmission. At the same time, we must destigmatize both the disease and its route of transmission. Targeted screening among populations with high risk for other sexually transmitted infections may be important strategies for case identification. Finally, further work should evaluate formally the transmissibility of human monkeypox from different bodily fluids through experimental studies and careful epidemiologic analyses with particular attention to the possibility of differing transmission dynamics in different regions of the globe."", 'This is interesting—thanks for sharing. A lot of people seem to be under the mistaken impression that monkeypox either is or is not an STI, when in reality the classification is context-dependent. The fact that monkeypox can be classified as an STI in Western Europe and the United States but not in Southern Africa underscores that point.']"

That said, there is a lot of harmful and unnecessary stigma around many STIs, and it’s good to unpack that first. Most STIs are easily treatable, easily preventable, and/or not that big a deal to have. \n\nDo your research and figure out what your risk tolerance is. How often do you want to get tested? What kinds of barriers do you want to use with your boyfriend, and with other partners? Many people use condoms for PIV and anal only, others use barriers for oral as well and might even use gloves for hand stuff depending on how worried you are about it. \n\nAsk for recent test results from new partners, but they’re never 100% foolproof bc many STIs can take weeks or months to show up. There’s always risk. It’s like driving a car— every time you get in one, you’re putting yourself at risk.

I know that news are alway abbreviated and simplified versions of science, and titles are often misleading. So I always try to find out the full version and/or research the topic myself."", 'Very true. Thanks for the response. You’re a smartie - would you say broadcast news tv is more guilty of some of this junk than print media? (Social media being the biggest offender). Just wondering your POV. Thanks.', ""I'm European, so my understanding of broadcast news TV in the US is somewhat skewed. But I saw a post the other day about a lot of news channels delivering the same message verbatim, so I wouldn't trust those. Junk print media as well, as the name implies, is junk, rubbish if it comes to science news. The other commenter got into how to judge science news in more detail, so I'll refrain from giving more advice. All in all, it's difficult to discern fake science from actual science if you're not a scientist yourself."", 'Thanks for your reply and insight. I must say, the only area where Europe is more cheeky than the US is print media. Your tabloids are just awful. The lies and scandals. We have pretty much banished the trashy ones here and there is only one tabloid newspaper left that gets any attention with its screaming headlines (The New York Post). I only rely on information from what consider the closest thing to proper journalism and news telling. I get five newspapers a day (all digital). To keep a fair and balanced look at the world and to see other perspectives that may challenge me a little I get The Wall Street Journal and, yes, The Post for the right wing conservative news, The Guardian for more international news and The Washington Post and The New York Times for the left leaning opinions. Great journalism but they are “too woke” at times. I also love The Atlantic - awesome journalism. And Reddits top news feed isn’t bad if you want a quick glance at what is going on around the world. No TV news at all. In fact, no TV. Crap. I have several streaming services where I watch well scripted and acted programming. I am completely reality TV free because I hate it. I am basically a huge reader that tries to learn all points of view, weigh them and then make up my own mind. Thanks again for your reply - I greatly appreciate it. Have a very good week!']"

Let me preface by saying I’m the oddball in my family, all my older siblings have achieved great things whilst I’m just ordinary, I’m intelligent and do well in school but have lived in my siblings shadow all my life , I’m also an atheist and have liberal opinions, my mother on the other hand is very religious and conservative and this has led to a lot of fights between as she always complains about me not attending church even though I just sleep on Sundays .\n\nI live a pretty tame life I’m introverted and just scroll tiktok while I prepare for my SAT to leave the country .I enjoy talking to my siblings who don’t live close to home ,My mother is very vocal about how she doesn’t consider my opinions as valid since in her opinion I don’t have enough life experience and achievement to know what I’m talking about.\n\n\nLately she’s been more vocal going as far as complaining about me to a stranger because I abandoned my apprenticeship in sewing due to a hostile work environment. She went further to agree with the stranger who is also a tailor that I’d be disadvantaged since women don’t have rights in my country after they get married and practical belong to their husbands, i was so hurt since I didn’t expect that from her, we aren’t poor and I’m not staying in my country to settle down and I thought she knew this , I confronted her in private and she said she’s doing it for my own good and that she wants me to sit up and that she has a right to do that as my mother.\n\nFast forward to sunday family meeting where we all get together and talk about our lives and how our week had been, I mentioned monkey pox vaccine and my mother immediately went on a rant about how God wouldn’t let my siblings get it and how I shouldn’t talk about monkey pox.\n\n\nLater when we were reminiscing about how she once scolded our oldest for something small and even went as far as reporting him to the neighbors she interjected about how I would overeat and then exercise which she knows I’m struggling with as well as struggling with depression and am currently in therapy, when I shot back she asked me if I’d ever earned a dime in my life amongst other things that I can’t remember.\n\nWhen the network went off I told her I don’t like how she provokes me and then plays the Victim making me look bad, i said i don’t want to emotionally detach myself from her but she’s making it hard , she left the meeting and we haven’t spoken since. I recorded a voice note explaining how I felt and attached screenshots of my siblings agreeing with me and I got no reply. I’d also add that my mom had been abused a lot in her marriage with my dad so maybe that’s why she acts that way so am I the ahole\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It also can be spread by respiratory secretions during prolonged, face-to-face contact (within a 6-foot radius for >3 hours), or during intimate physical contact, such as kissing, cuddling, or sex. In addition, pregnant people can spread the virus to their fetus through the placenta.\n\n> Touching items (such as clothing or linens) that previously touched the infectious rash or body fluids is another way monkeypox spreads. It’s also possible for people to get monkeypox from infected animals, either by being scratched or bitten by the animal or by eating meat or using products from an infected animal.']"

Monkeypox may be among the queer community right now, but it won’t be for long if attitudes remain that it’s limited to queer folx. The question you should be asking is “is the burn community at large concerned about Monkeypox?” The good news is that vaccines are slowly being distributed (too slowly, but they are still going out) to at risk communities like mine in NYC. It’s also a disease that is visually presenting in most cases, and I know that if I thought I might have it I would stay home. Most people whose communities have been affected would probably say the same. You do not want to get it as it’s painful and lasts a long time.\n2. It spreads primarily through skin to skin contact. The burn is a place where lots of people are usually touching each other. If you are concerned about exposure you need to take precautions and get comfortable with asking anybody you have intimate contact with out there about mpx safety before you sleep with them. Doesn’t matter who it is.\n3. Queer camps know better than most that this is a risk. I can’t speak for them, but as a queer man in NYC I can say that we aren’t idiots. We’re a sexually active community that thrives on touch and being close to one another. We’re taking precautions, and so should you. Part of civic responsibility on my own part is staying home if I were to get sick. It’s yours too.\n\nSo the question you should be asking is: what is YOUR camp doing about monkeypox? Have you had that conversation? You should, even if you don’t think it’ll affect you or that you are at high risk.']"
