### LDA Instructions/Requirements

### LIWC Instructions/Requirements
LIWC File requires/uses the LIWC_2015.dic file. 

This needs to be supplied by the user as a license must be purchased to acquire and use this file.

To run the code for the LIWC analysis, you can just run the python liwc script in ```scripts/liwc_analysis.py```. 

This file serves as both a collection of methods for analysis and a playground (at the bottom of the file) to run methods. Some code comments and type-hints are provided in methods to generally explain how the methods work.

NOTE: You will need to define the path variables at the beginning of the script but recommended file paths are provided in the code comments.

Some examples on how to run the various methods for calculating t-test, LIWC category word usage, and Kruskal-Wallis tests are present at the bottom of the file. Feel free to experiment with them at your leisure.
